- Load database data by running, from within the 'sql scripts' directory, ```python3 updateDB.py```

## Frontend
Run ```npm start``` in repo dir

## Backend
Run ```python3 -m uvicorn backend_main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload``` in repo dir
Or run the script ```./run-backend``` in the root directory


## Sample SQL in/out
- Inside the test_sql_queries directory has all features sample/prod with the SQL command and the text file.
- Can be regenerated by changing password in the command inside run_features.py and running ```python3 run_features.py```
- All sql commands generate production data, as our sample dataset is just a subset of production
